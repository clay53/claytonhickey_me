                <a href="https://www.rfleury.com/">Hidden Grove</a> by Ryan Fleury - a blog with lots of low-level programming (C language) insights that I have found really intriguing. He has a GUI tutorial that I haven't read yet. I didn't really know about it until I retired my GUI library project.

                <a href="http://Livakivi">@Livakivi on YouTube</a> - talks about his journey learning Japanese in an entertaining way and other interesting, imo niche topics. He has extreme dedication to everything he does, it seems.

                <a href="https://polygloss.app/posts">Polygloss Blog</a> - Polygloss is, imo, the best language learning app for output available right now. The creator also has a lot of interesting things to say on their blog. Unfortunately, my language learning app will beat them - one day üòî.

Everyone involved in Free Software should read his post explaining, indisputably, <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2023/11/25/2023-11-26-RMS-on-sex.html">Richard Stallman openly supporting pedophilia</a>.

                <a href="https://twitter.com/BakerEDMLab">@BakerEDMLab on ùïè</a> - <a href="https://learninganalytics.upenn.edu/ryanbaker/">Professor Ryan Baker</a>'s lab from my university, the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, in the field of (mostly language) Learning Analytics. They publish interesting papers about language learning.

                I am currently dumbfounded because for the past ~2.5 months (2024-02-28 at the time of writing), I have heard, read, and said ‚ÄúLearning Analytics‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúLanguage Analytics‚Äù, but ‚ÄúLearning Analytics‚Äù sounds even cooler! I never understood what ‚ÄúLanguage Analytics‚Äù meant, and now I know why üò≠. I exchanged emails with him, had a meeting with him, had dinner with him (and other professors, including his wife, and other students), discussed his work with others and still thought this. I must be dyslexic or something.

                <a href="https://asahilinux.org/blog/">Asahi Linux Blog</a> - one of the coolest things happening in the free software space right now. An interesting blog to read if you're interested in how one could possibly get Linux working with GPU hardware acceleration on the new ARM Macs.

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman">Lex Fridman podcast</a> - while I, personally, find Lex a little dry, I find a decent proportion of the people he interviews to be very interesting. I appreciate how Lex has people on that I, and I imagine usually he agrees, are at least a little crazy and don't share much common ground with. It's always good to understand the perspective of someone whose perspective you would want to change, so it's good preparation for an argument (though, nowadays, I don't get involved in many arguments - really just the idea makes it more fun for me). When it gets completely unhinged, I also find that weirdly fascinating.

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOCWBhuDdDo">Tucker Carlson's Interview with Putin (2024-02-06)</a> - I don't know much about Tucker Carlson, Putin, Ukraine, Russia, etc., but it seems to me as something one should watch if they want to have a credible perspective on the geopolitics surrounding the relationships between the US, Ukraine, and Russia.
