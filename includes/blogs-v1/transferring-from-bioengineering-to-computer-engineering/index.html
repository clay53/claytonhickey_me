<h1>Transferring from Bioengineering to Computer Engineering</h1>
<p>Sophomore winter break January 4th I sent in the form transfer from Bioengineering to Computer Engineering.</p>
<p>I wanted to move from bioengineering because the classes, they way people talk about it, and where students go afterwards (like 90&amp; don't do engineering) gave me terrible vibes.</p>
<p>I made the following graph to demonstrate my reasoning for choosing computer engineering over bioengineering.:</p>

    <figcaption>Interest is slightly higher or the same each term for computer engineering. Workload is slightly better or the same for each term except Spring 2025.<br><a href="/blog/transferring-from-bioengineering-to-computer-engineering/UPenn Course Plan - Computer Engineering-3.pdf">Computer Engineering Calculations</a> <a href="/blog/transferring-from-bioengineering-to-computer-engineering/UPenn Course Plan - BE Calculations.pdf">Bioengineering Calculations</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I chose Computer Engineering over Computer Science because I like engineering more than science.</p>
<p>I chose Computer Engineering over Electrical Engineering because they're nearly the same if choosing the computer engineering concentration and I don't know any better.</p> 
<p>I chose Computer Engineering over dropping out because I want money?</p>
<p>I am excited to learn the vibes of computer engineers.</p>
