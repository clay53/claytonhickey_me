Mathematical Proof: You Should Just Start Reading in Your Target Language
For Christmas 2 years ago, I received every light novel of Re:Zero in Japanese, but I still can't read them fluently because I am still not good at Japanese. So, in this blog post, I create a model to demonstrate the rapid progress one would make by just starting to read in one's target language.

A graph of the predicted recognition chance of Re:Zero Volume 1 showing word recognition rapidly increasing at the beginning and leveling off at around 80-90% after reading 20% of the book and sentence recognition increasing slowly, with some acceleration towards the end, to about 20%.

<h1>Mathematical Proof: You Should Just Start Reading in Your Target Language</h1>
<p>The goal is to find a function to approximate the ease of reading as a function as progress through a book with the assumption that nothing is known at the beginning of reading.</p>
<p>To create a model to simulate one's mind when reading a book, let's first set up some variables.</p>
<p>Let \(n=\)the number of unique words in the book</p>
<p>Let \(L=\)the total number of words in the book</p>
<p>We will consider the list of unique words in the book to be ordered from most frequent to least frequent and numbered 1 to \(n\)</p>
<p>Let \(p(w)\) be a function that gets the frequency of the \(w\)th word in the list</p>
<p>According <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law" target="_BLANK">Zipf's Law</a>, the frequency of each word will be equal to \(p(w)=\frac{f_1}{w}\) where \(f_1\) is the frequency of the most frequent word (\(w=1\)).</p>
<p>The sum of the frequencies of the words, \(\sum_{w=1}^{n}p(w)\), will be equal to \(100\%\) simply because the chance of a given word being any word in the list of all possible words is \(100\%\).</p>
<p>Therefore, to find \(f_1\) so that we can fully define \(p(w)\), we need to find what value of \(f_1\) will make the equality \(\sum_{w=1}^{n}p(w)=\sum_{w=1}^{n}\frac{f_1}{w}=100\%\) true.</p>
<p>\(\sum_{w=1}^{n}\frac{f_1}{w}=100\%\)</p>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<p>\(f_1*\sum_{w=1}^{n}\frac{1}{w}=100*\frac{1}{100}\)</p>
<p>because multiplying each term of the sum by \(f_1\) is the same as multiplying the whole sum by \(f_1\) and \(\%=\frac{1}{100}\) by definition. Simplifying the right side and then dividing each side by \(\sum_{w=1}^{n}\frac{1}{w}\) to isolate \(f_1\) then yields:</p>
<p>\(f_1=\frac{1}{\sum_{w=1}^{n}\frac{1}{w}}\)</p>
<p>This cannot be simplified any further because \(\sum_{w=1}^{n}\frac{1}{w}\) is the partial sum of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)#Partial_sums" target="_BLANK">harmonic series</a> which does not have a simpler solution, but you can use a calculator to calculate it. It can also be approximated by \(\frac{1}{ln(n)}\) (a slight overestimate).</p>
<p>Continuing expanding on the model:</p>
<p>Let \(r=\) the chance of learning a word after seeing it</p>
<p>Let \(k(w,i)=\)the probability of remembering the \(w\)th most frequent word after reading \(i\) words</p>
<p>by the opposite:</p>
<p>\(k(w,i)=100\%-\)the probability of not remembering the \(w\)th most frequent word after reading \(i\) words</p>
<p>from \(i\) repeated independent events (not really independent, but it's only a slight underestimate):</p>
<p>\(k(w,i)=100\%-(\)the probability of not learning the \(w\)th most frequent word after reading a word\()^i\)</p>
<p>by the opposite:</p>
<p>\(k(w,i)=100\%-(100\%-\)the probability of learning the \(w\)th most frequent word after reading a word\()^i\)</p>
<p>\(k(w,i)=100\%-(100\%-\)the probability of reading the \(w\)th most frequent word\(*\)the probability of learning a word after seeing it\()^i\)</p>
<p>\(k(w,i)=100\%-(100\%-p(w)*r)^i\)</p>
<p>converting from percents \(100\%=1\):</p>
<p>\(k(w,i)=1-(1-p(w)*r)^i\)</p>
<p>This completes the definition of \(k(w,i)\) because \(r\) is a variable we manually manipulate, \(p(w)\) is already defined, and \(w\) and \(i\) are inputs.</p>
<p>Let \(e_w(i)=\)the probability of remembering the \(i\)th word read</p>
<p>Let \(e_w(i)=\)the sum of the probabilities of remembering each word after reading \(i\) words weighted by the probability of seeing each word</p>
<p>\(e_w(i)=\sum_{w=1}^{n}(\)the probability of remembering the \(w\)th most frequent word\(*\)the probability of seeing the \(w\)th most frequent word\()\)</p>
<p>\(e_w(i)=\sum_{w=1}^{n}(k(w,i)*p(w))\)</p>
<p>This completes the definition of \(y(i)\).</p>
<p>Let \(a=\)the average sentence length</p>
<p>Let \(e_s(i)=\)the probability of remembering all the words in the next sentence after reading \(i\) words</p>
<p>\(e_s(i)=\)the probability of remembering the next \(a\) words after reading \(i\) words</p>
<p>by repeated \(a\) repeated independent events (assuming nothing was learned from the next \(a\) words):</p>
<p>\(e_s(i)=(\)the probability of remembering a word after reading \(i\) words\()^a\)</p>
<p>\(e_s(i)=(e_w(i))^a\)</p>
<p>Let \(E_w(t)=\)the chance of remembering the next word after reading \(t\) percent of the book</p>
<p>\(E_w(t)=e_w(\)how many words read after reading \(t\) percent of the book\()\)</p>
<p>\(E_w(t)=e_w(\)the number of words in the book\(*\)the percent of words read\()\)</p>
<p>\(E_w(t)=e_w(L*t)\)</p>
<p>Let \(E_s(t)=\)the chance of remembering the next sentence after reading \(t\) percent of the book</p>
<p>\(E_s(t)=e_s(\)how many words read after reading \(t\) percent of the book\()\)</p>
<p>\(E_w(t)=e_s(\)the number of words in the book\(*\)the percent of words read\()\)</p>
<p>\(E_w(t)=e_s(L*t)\)</p>
<p>This completes the model as we have found a few functions \((e_w(i), e_s(i), E_w(t), E_s(t))\) to estimate the ease of reading as a function of progress. Below is an implementation of the model you can manipulate (note: not all the input variables will be used depending on the calculation).</p>

<p>Based on the model, for me to have a 50% of remembering the next word when reading the first volume of Re:Zero, which as 7519 unique words and 52997 words total (according jpdb.io: <a href="https://jpdb.io/novel/1611/re-zero-starting-life-in-another-world" target="_BLANK">https://jpdb.io/novel/1611/re-zero-starting-life-in-another-world</a>), assuming I knew 0 Japanese before reading and that I had a 50% chance of learning a word each time I saw it (probably assisted by Anki), I would only have to read about 1.27% of the book (or about 4 pages) to have about a 50% chance knowing the next word, which is much less than I thought.</p>

<p>By using <a href="https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan" target="_BLANK">Yomitan</a> for reading on the web, <a href="https://takoboto.jp/" target="_BLANK">Takoboto</a> for dictionary lookup on mobile (and creating Anki cards), and Google's Japanese handwriting OCR, I have reduced the friction of looking up new words a lot. So, that combined with the promising predictions has made pushing through reading difficult material a lot more encouraging.</p>
