Language Learning Log Week #3
This week, I started reading again, but not that much because of school. I also found out about Language Simp and little about how to talk to people.

<h1>Language Learning Log Week #3</h1>
<p>This week, I had a 3 finals. Chemistry went great (I think), linear algebra went ok (I hope), discrete math went terrible (definitely). Regardless, I distracted myself by reading some Re:Zero this week. I read a total of 52 characters in about an hour and a half. I made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x479E1OIDQWg4e_PLUq79xCDrOxV13z8gxkNY7COx-8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_BLANK">cool spreadsheet</a> to make the following mid graph to demonstrate it:</p>

    <figcaption>On Sunday and Monday, I read at ~34 characters/hour for ~46 minutes</figcaption>

<p>26 characters an hour is pretty slow. Assuming 2 characters/word (based on nothing), that's 13 words per hour. Part of the trouble is that I'm entering it into Tutor Engine at the same time. However, entering it into Tutor Engine at the same time I think helps lot with remembering it and I help the app along at the same time.</p>
<p>Next week after school is over on Tuesday, I'll be starting my planned summer regiment: wake at sunrise (~6 am), bike (~30 minute sprint; now 6:30 am), eat (~30 minutes; now 7:00 am), shower (~30 minutes; now 7:30 am), work on Tutor Engine (1 hour - increase over time; now 8:30 am), study Japanese (1 hour; now 8:30 am), do whatever I want the rest of the day. For the Japanese study, I will start with reading as I have, and then try different strategies to increase speed, retention, and happiness. This should work assuming I don't get an opportunity to do something more rewarding, which seems likely at this point.</p> 
<p>I also did the minimum on Duolingo each day this week, but who cares? I also did not use LingQ.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing I actually did this week was find out about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LanguageSimp" target="_BLANK">@LanguageSimp</a> on YouTube. I found it very inspiring to be called a monolingual beta multiple times. I also love his linguistic vocabulary like calling "American English" "American". He explains his position on linguistics for language learning in his video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQL3CJB72lM" target="_BLANK">"Why I HATE Linguistics"</a>. Further thinking about this led me to a simple rule of thumb: if the first time you've understood the "strict" meaning of a word was after it was explained in an advanced scientific setting, people not in a similar setting (of their own will) probably won't and don't want to understand it. For example, in the <a target="/blog/language-learning-log-week-1">first week's post</a>, I tried to use "script" to describe what most people would intuitively understand as an "alphabet" even though "alphabet", in a linguistics setting, would not be technically correct. I am sorry to have been so pedantic.</p>
<p>Anyway, I should study for my physics final.<br><br>Good luck doing whatever as long as it's not bad,<br>Clayton</p>
