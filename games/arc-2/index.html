Endless Arcade Game by Hayden Shuker
<p>Endless Arcade Game. You need to press A+D (at the same exact time) for the game to actually start. The goal of the game is to get the highest score. To gain score, collect purple squares or clear a stage by hitting a pink square. You have two minutes to get as many points and stage clears as possible. To submit your score (only if using the CDT branch - currently), type your name in the box below the main player and hit "Submit High Score". Note: this game was developed by Hayden Shuker, not Clayton Hickey.</p>
